SDF is the more scalable format, and it is the format that is recommended. However, they should be mostly interchangeable with small syntax differences.\n- .obj on the other hand, is a file format that describes the *geometry* of an object, such as a mesh of the surface of the object.\n  - There exist other geometry formats, such as .stl, and .dae. These are not well-supported by Drake directly, but [Meshlab](https://www.meshlab.net/), an open-source software, is a handy tool to convert common formats to a `.obj` for you.\n- [Model directives](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/structdrake_1_1multibody_1_1parsing_1_1_model_directive.html) are a YAML specification that makes it easy to load multiple URDF and SDF objects into a simulation. They're used at the bottom of this notebook.\n","block_group":"a6646554e869412393d6528704451ed1"},{"cellId":"ef5c6954b9e140bf94e5b026179defaa","cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"ef5c6954b9e140bf94e5b026179defaa","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"The most important formats for creating multibody scenarios in Drake are the [Unified Robot Description Format (URDF)](http://wiki.ros.org/urdf) and the [Simulation Description Format (SDFormat)](http://sdformat.org/).\n\nThey are both XML formats to describe robots or objects for robot simulators or visualization, and are fairly similar in syntax.\n\nIn a high-level sense, you express different components of your robot using `<link>` tags and connect them via `<joint>` tags. Each `<link>` has three major subtags, `<visual>`, `<collision>`, and `<inertial>`, for its visualization, planning/collision checking, and dynamics aspects. For `<visual>` and `<collision>`, you can either use primitives (box, sphere, cylinder, etc.) or meshes (.obj) to represent the underlying geometry.\n\nThe supported primitive types and the supported file types for meshes are described [here](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__geometry__file__formats.html).

File 2 uses hydroelastic contact, and file 1 uses the default point contact model.\n\n[Hydroelastic contact](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__hydroelastic__user__guide.html) in Drake can be used to create compliant collision geometries. This is a great tool for improving the contact dynamics between simulated objects, compared to traditional rigid contact geometries.\n\nAnswer the following questions in your written submission.\n\n**Part (a):**  How is the collision geometry (not contact models!) different in File 1 than File 2? What tags enable hydroelastic contact in File 2?\n\n**Part (b):**  In both files, we use the sugar box obj mesh as the visual geometry. For File 2, we could have used the obj mesh as the collision geometry too. In one sentence, why might we prefer to specify the collision geometry using primitives, rather than using the obj mesh?

You have a lot of freedom here. Ideally, this object can be used in your final project. It doesn't have to be an object your robot can pick up; it can be anything you want in your simulation. \n\n- The only requirement is it cannot be directly taken from the existing models in Drake without modification.\n- Your model file can be in any of the formats supported by the [Parser](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/classdrake_1_1multibody_1_1_parser.html), but we recommend using SDF. Your model should use hydroelastic contact.\n\nOne option is to find a 3D model online, such as at [TurboSquid](https://www.turbosquid.com/3d-model/free), and convert it into a .obj file. The .obj file can then be directly turned into a SDF file by using the below terminal command, documented [here](https://drake.mit.edu/pydrake/pydrake.multibody.mesh_to_model.html). On Deepnote, you can open a terminal on the left bar and run the command after you have uploaded your .obj file. \n```sh\npython3 -m pydrake.multibody.mesh_to_model --scale=1.0 path/to/mesh.obj\n```\n\nWe have a more advanced version of this tool available in `manipulation/create_sdf_from_mesh.py`, which additionally supports convex decomposition of a nonconvex mesh and mesh simplification. This isn't needed for this problem, but may be very useful for your project.\n\nAnother option is to purely use SDF and geometric primitives to compose primitives (and maybe meshes) to build up your object. \n\nYet another option is to look at object databases curated for robotics such as YCB. Note that\nsome are existing models in Drake [here](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/models/tree/master/ycb), but there are more not included!\n\nHere's some more examples of various SDF files to use as inspiration or a guide: \n- [Rubik's Cube](https://deepnote.com/workspace/Manipulation-ac8201a1-470a-4c77-afd0-2cc45bc229ff/project/02-Lets-get-you-a-robot-8f86172b-b597-4ceb-9bad-92d11ac7a6cc/notebook/rubiks_cube-35164353b13d4a47910ca14e588c74d6?)\n- [Drake examples](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/tree/master/examples), which includes things such as a bouncing ball. \n- If there was a [final project](https://manipulation.csail.mit.edu/misc.html#projects) that had objects you'd like to use, see if their code is open source or ask!\n\nOnce you have created your model file, fill in the **absolute path** below. On Deepnote, there is an option on the left bar to copy paths into your clipboard. \n\n**Part (c):** In your written submission, briefly describe what your object is. Take a screenshot of your object on the table in simulation (the final code cell). Your screenshot should include red contact force arrows and not green contact force arrows, which indicate that you are using hydroelastic contact.
