This problem set helps to understand one of the reasons why we can abstract many manipulation problems kinematically (purely in terms of joint angles and end-effector positions), as opposed to worrying about dynamics (joint torques and inertias). Even before going to the multi-link case, let's think about how we should control the position of a single pendulum.\n\nIn this problem you will investigate the role of reflected inertia in position control of a simple pendulum. At the end of the notebook, you will be able to check your work in a simulation environment.\n\n**These are the main steps of the exercise:**\n1. Write down the state-space dynamics function for the simple pendulum with motor and gearbox.\n2. Set up a PID Controller to do position control for the simple pendulum.\n3. Qualitatively answer the difference in behavior between direct-drive and gearbox cases.\n\n\n**Your job for this problem set**\nWill be to do step 1 and 3 of the main steps.\n\n","block_group":"a63278b9dd20401e8e91b006e39f8181"},{"cellId":"eb1c0732b38b45c5ad80d5387330f995","cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"zGGyX76oBXGN","colab_type":"text","cell_id":"eb1c0732b38b45c5ad80d5387330f995","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"## The Simple Pendulum\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RussTedrake/manipulation/master/book/figures/exercises/simple_pendulum.png\" width=\"400\">\n\nThe [simple pendulum](https://underactuated.csail.mit.edu/pend.html) is perhaps the simplest abstraction of a 'manipulator', with the following equation for dynamics:\n\n$$ ml^2 \\ddot{q} = -mgl\\sin(q) + \\tau$$\n\nLet's first write down the dynamics of a pendulum in a first-order form,\n$$\\dot{x}=f(x,u)$$\n\nwhere $x=[q,\\dot{q}]^T$ is now our state vector, and our input $u=\\tau$.\n\n$$\\frac{d}{dt}\\begin{bmatrix} q \\\\ \\dot{q} \\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix} \\dot{q} \\\\ (-mgl\\sin(q) + \\tau) / ml^2 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nThe following function returns $\\dot{x}$ given $x,u$, and the parameters.\n\nNOTE: For a sine implementation, we will be using `pydrake`'s `sin` for this problem set instead of the numpy implementation.
